# Arithmetic Game Project

An app that lets a user choose their difficulty and what operation they want to practice. Asks how many questions they want to do, then gives them questions.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can choose a difficulty.
* [ ] User can choose what operation to practice.
* [ ] User can choose how many questions they want.
* [ ] User can choose to play again after endin the game.

The following **extensions** are implemented:
