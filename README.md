# Arithmetic Game Project

An app that lets a user choose their difficulty and what operation they want to practice. Asks how many questions they want to do, gives them questions, takes their answers and gives them their score.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can choose a difficulty.
* [ ] User can choose what operation to practice.
* [ ] User can choose how many questions they want.
* [ ] User sees their score after finishing the round.

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* If no difficulty is selected, automatically gives user the hardest difficulty.
* If no operation is selected, automatically gives user the hardest operation in my opinion, division.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

I managed to get the final score operational after it wasn't in the last project. Fixed some crashes when enter was pressed on inputting user's answer to a question.
